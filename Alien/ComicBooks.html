                    <h2>A short descreption of the comic books</h2>
                    The first three stories formed a continuation of the two Alien films that had been released by the time they were published. However, 1992 saw the release of Alien 3, which contradicted the events of the comics by beginning with the deaths of Newt and Corporal Hicks. In order to keep the stories relevant to the main Alien film series, Dark Horse changed the names of the characters for future printings of the stories. Newt became Billie while Hicks was now known as Wilks. The only other major difference between the original publications is that as well as being renamed the trade paperbacks were also recolored

                    Between 1999 and 2008 the line was on hiatus.

                    In 2020, the comic rights to the Aliens franchise were sold to Marvel Comics, ending the Dark Horse Comics line. As well as producing their own original comics, Marvel have the right to reprint at least some of the previous Dark Horse stories, and as of 2022 several have been republished in new collections and/or as digital comics.
